Takes an array as an input and displays a plain text table output that looks similar to a MySQL command line result table.

Roadmap:

**Support a maximum field/table width so that it can be used for plain-text emails.**

**Support field vertical tables in addition to horizontal ones (so the field names run down the side instead of across the top).**
